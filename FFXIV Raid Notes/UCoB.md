**Thunders**

Go on the other side of the boss if *hallowed moon*, go away if not *hallowed moon*

If you have Thunder and Fire at once Thunder goes off first, step away firt and then run to the group if it's Fire in.

Cleanse order: 6s, 10s, 16s

Drop cleanse puddle and rotate CW around Nael.

**Fire tethers**

In -> Out -> In -> In

If people die during P2 order remains the same but non-tethered people go out or stay in depending on what they need. If you have ice on you take the fire, if you don't then don't take it.

Tanks grab tethers and take them in healers earthshakers.
Non-shaker DPS stack south.

---

**Blackfire**

Start center, run to Nael. DPS circle left, support circle right. Healer takes the tower away from Nael, stack away from Nael. Wait until 2nd AoE is thrown before taking tower to not bait it on the tower.

Party on Nael, mid is relative north.

```
      Mid

  L1        R1
L2    Nael    R2
L3            R3
  L4        R4
```


Stack behind Nael if it's in.

*From on high...* : Spread -> In -> Spread

*From hallowed moon...* : In -> Spread -> Spread

Tanks grab tethers immediately after hallowed moon, L tank goes left, R tank goes right looking at middle.

**Heavensfall**

Dodge dives using Quickmarch positions.

If Nael is mid L1 and R1 go front, L4 and R4 go back.

Dodge twisters immediately after dives.

If there's a tower on Nael R1 takes it.

Dodge in a spiral towards the center for the stack.

**Tenstrike**

Spread in Quickmarch positions based on true north.

Hatch marker people take first orbs, then go directly away from middle and non-marked people intercept.

Group up a little for heals between hatches and eathshakers.

Earthshakers bait SE, SW and slightly north of E and W. rest of the group waits north. People waiting for 2nd shakers spread slightly to indicate which shaker they take.

---

**Grand Octet**

Bahamut needs to be <= 60% when Grand Octet starts or P4 is a wipe.

Start in the middle, wait for markers to appear.

Dodge opposite of Bahamut and rotate around the arena CW. If Nael is directly opposite of Bahamut dodge 1 position CCW of Nael and rotate CCW.

When red dive marker appears run towards middle. Tank LB3 when goin middle to cheese the stack.

The person who didn't get a dive marker during the dodge baits Twintania. Bait left looking at Twintania.

Stack generally right from Twintania, but not needed with LB3.

Hatches

Twister comes after Generate, person taking south Neurolink needs to be careful to not put their twister in Neurolink.
